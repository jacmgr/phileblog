This is an experimental site for my personal use to learn more about programming in php and Content Management Systems. (I am just a hobbyist learning in my spare time). Feel free to ask questions, or [MENTOR ME PLEASE](about).  In general, the audience for this site is myself. *You may find things broken here now and then*.

This site is running my fork of the [PHILE][phile] cms system and implements ideas from [PICO][pico] and [WIKITTEN][wikitten] cms systems.  I have tried to modify phile as little as possible.  I called this **jaccms** to avoid confusion and not give phile cms a bad name, but basically it is [PHILE][phile] under the hood.  I don't expect others to download and use my fork.  

##How I landed at Phile 

I started with [PICO][pico] and [WIKITTEN][wikitten]. Those two packages are great.  They share these characteristics:

* No database or admin. All content is simple markdown text files in a folder structure.
* complete and perform their intended function flawlessly out of the box.
* contained in a **single php file**.
* small, only 350 to 600 lines of php code.

Because those systems were _complete, single file, and small_, I was able to study, learn, and eventually understand almost of it. You can track through their source and follow all actions to their outputted results. It was refreshing to finally find a CMS system that I could grasp beginning to end.  True they are not advanced CMS systems, but for my purpose of learning these two systems were just what I needed. And each pf them does exactly what they say they do.  

After that, I Wanted to really learn about OOP.  As I read several tutorials I realized I needed a real application that I could study and PHILE was it.  Phile was still very small, but had everything the OOP tutorials kept talking about. Phile also built on everything I had learned from wikitten and pico.  So many of my phile plugins are based directly on the ideas and code in pico and wikitten.

> That's how this site comes to be using [Phile][phile].  And I am still learning. I finally settled my [personal blog](http://www.jhinline.com/urichip) using PHILE as well.

> This site and code is a learning process for me. It is not intended to be a product for distribution.  The product is the learning.
