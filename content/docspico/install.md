## Installing jaccms

The short answer is [download](%base_url%/downloads) and unzip to a folder or sub-folder on your server. That's it, your done. Go to **http://yourwebsite/yourfolder** and jaccms will fire up with the default content.

If it is not, you may need to edit your .htaccess file.

All of the jaccms documentation is included in the distribution under the folder docs.
## Throw some content up

Copy a bunch of your  .md files into the content folder.  Create some subfolder like "content/test/" and throw your documents in there.  Browse to the index and see how jaccms reacts.
