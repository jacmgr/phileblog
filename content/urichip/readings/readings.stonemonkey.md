### The Stone Monkey: An Alternative, Chinese-Scientific, Reality

Read this book back in 1982.  Found an old copy this week.  Will give it another shot.

The book seems to get a strange spectrum of reviews from love it to hate it.   Can't seem to find much else about it online.

I do remember from 30 years ago being fascinated with some of the insights.  The possibility that Cadillacs replaced dinosaurs, and other such imagery.
