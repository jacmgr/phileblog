Snowpiercer is [movie about a future where a failed global-warming experiment][imdb] kills off most life on the planet, a class system evolves aboard the Snowpiercer, a train that travels around the globe via a perpetual-motion engine.

I went to see this movie with my sister.  The story was interesting, but [[#ENDSUMMARY]]it was a little long and boring.  It was directed by a Korean director, but most of the actors were american. Only 2 actors were korean.  The movie was in English, but the korean actors spoke in korean.  In the movie the train had an electronic translator device so all characters could understand each other.
