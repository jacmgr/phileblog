Hyonmi's sister is staying with us for a little bit.  She's fun and a great cook. So I am likely to eat well while she is here!  She just had arthroscopic surgery on both knees.  She's recovering well.

I didn't know much about [ARTHROSCOPIC SURGERY](http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00299) and did some research.  Quite interesting.  Here is some [surgery information in korean](http://www.yuhs.or.kr/en/hospitals/severance/clinic_dept/OrthoSur_dept/intro/) as well.
