Hyonmi and I were very lucky to have a chance to travel to ITALY this spring (2008). It was actually a group trip. The main part of the group goes back to our Thailand Days in the early 1980's. The group has grown over the years with spouses, loved ones, and friends of the original group. The trip was conceived by Anne and mostly developed by Pam and Paula.
[[#ENDSUMMARY]]
Basically we spent the first week in a villa together doing day trips all over Tuscany Region. After the group week finished, John and Hyonmi had another 4 days in Italy. We mostly day tripped out of Florence and found Venice, Pisa, and Lucca.

We started in ROME for one quick night and then took the train to Florence and back to Pongi Bonsi where the VILLA was located. From the VILLA we mostly did small and large group day trips and ended the day back at the VILLA for wine, snacks, dinner, conversation, and what was that game called?
