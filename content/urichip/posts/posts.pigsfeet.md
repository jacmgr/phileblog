Went to eat with the friends last night.  The main course was Pig's leg ("trotter") called "Jok-Bal" 족발 in Korean.

Folks will tell you Jok-Bal is good for skin and preventing wrinkles.  Mostly because due to the long cooking method, there is a lot of collagen in it.  Like all things though, it is as much about the experience as the menu.  You need to go to a place famous for the type of food you are choosing.  

This time we went to [a Jok Bal restaurant in Mapo (near the 궁중족발)][restlink1].  There's is a Jok Bal Alley with several vendors in the alley.  There's a map at the end of that webpage.  Basically take Subway Line 5 or 6 to Gongdeok Station (공덕역) and use Exit 5.  After that go straight forward and you'll see it.

Lot's of other stuff to see at [Gongdaek Subway Station (공덕역)][restlink2]

Next time we will try the [족발 JokBal restaurants in our area][restlink3]

You can see more [about this dish here](%wikipedia%Jokbal).
