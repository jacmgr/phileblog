I have several sites related to [Boltwire](www.boltwire.com), the web engine that runs this site.

## jacmgr's Boltwire Blog
[jacmgr's Boltwire Blog](http://www.jhinline.com/BW35/home) is the place I blog about my boltwire activities.

## Documentation Project
I have been reworking and organizing the _Boltwire Documentation_ for my own use.  Currently focused on version 3.5/3.4 but will also do it for version 4.0.    This [documentation project](http://www.jhinline.com/BW35/docs) allows me to learn more about sorting and organizing a site with a very large number of pages.  Some thoughts on how to organize documentation, how an admin could sort the pages based on more than just the page names; how admin can toggle site comments on and off; etc...

## Boltwire Skin Site
This the place I show and distribute boltwire skins I worked on. There are skins for version 3.5 and 4.0.
