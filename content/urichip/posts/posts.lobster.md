We treated ourselves last night to an all you can eat lobster fest.   It was a special treat at a restaurant for us.  We very rarely have a chance to eat lobster.  It was a great feast with a mix of mussels, clams, shrimp, and mostly rock lobsters.  A nice cesar salad, cream soup, and all you can eat bread, and a piece of cheesecake for desert.  Probably another 5 years before we eat lobster again, but we really enjoyed it.
