[Stumbled upon this in the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/us/service-aids-fearful-drivers-across-the-chesapeake.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0) today.  Fear of Crossing Bridges has its own word: [Gephyrophobia](%wikipedia%Gephyrophobia).  Fascinating read there on [Gephyrophobia](%wikipedia%Gephyrophobia).  The fear is real, so it seems like there is potential for a nice retirement hobby to assist those with the phobia.  Drive them across the bridge.  I think that would be a cool way to spend a few afternoons a week.  Just have to find the right bridge.
[[#ENDSUMMARY]]

Apparently the [Chesapeake Bay Bridge](http://http://www.baybridge.maryland.gov/) has a very high rate of folks asking for assistance, while the [Tappen Zee Bridge](http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0000535) in New York only gets about 6 requests a year.

So which bridge should I retire near....
