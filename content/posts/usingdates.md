/*
title: Dates Any Format

Using dates in meta caused me problems.  ince they are treated as text, the never sorted correctly for me.   So I wrote a plugin that treats any meta with the word `date` in the keyname as a unix timestamp.  This makes it consistent for any other plugins or templates, and they sort reliably.
