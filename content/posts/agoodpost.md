Forget where I copied this from?

Confirm that the index.html is using TITLE, Description, Keywords from the page, and if  not, that it is using from overall site, and possibly from index.md

For example:

* A short sweet url that has the main keywords in it is best.
* A concise description that tells the website visitor what to expect.
* A catchy post title to catch the fish.
* An eye catching image with an ALT attribute that describes the image. (3 words at most)

Simple errors you might take for granted:

* Broken links
* Duplicate titles, descriptions, content
