##Mentor Me

 
I am not a programmer by trade or profession.  My work life has nothing to do with computers or programming. It is a hobby I mostly do in a vacuum. I know my code is sloppy and inefficient.  
 
If you would like to help me improve, please comment on these pages or contact me at jacmgr at yahoo dot com.
